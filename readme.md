# Playback Sensor

If you're like me and uses your Android device to play music while you're working, than this app will make your life easier :).

1 - Swipe over your device (locked or unlocked) and it will be skip to the next music.  
2 - Hold your hand over the device and the music will Start or Stop.  

This app uses the proximity sensor to achieve this feature, so make sure you wave your hand over the correct place (usually near the front facing camera), makes some tests to make sure you got it.  
This app will use media button events to control the music play, haven't found a media app that it doesn't work, so you're probably safe.
